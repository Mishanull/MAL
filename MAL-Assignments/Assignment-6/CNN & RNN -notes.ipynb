    "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), are particularly well-suited for tasks involving sequential data, like speech recognition, because they have \"memory\" in the form of hidden states that can carry information from one step in the sequence to another. This allows them to capture temporal dependencies in the data, which is crucial in speech recognition where the meaning of a sound can depend on the previous sounds.\n",

They can capture spatial hierarchies in the data by applying filters to different parts of the input, but they do not inherently capture temporal dependencies as LSTM networks do.\n",
